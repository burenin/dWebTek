		<h2>The Wiki Language</h2>
		<p>Wiki articles are normally authored in a non-XML syntax, where:</p> 
		<ul> 
			<li>An image looks like [[Image:url]].</li> 
			<li>Links look like [[word]], [[wiki:word]], and [url word].</li> 
			<li>The italics style is selected as ''...'', and the bold weight as '''...'''.</li> 
			<li>The fixed-width style is selected as &lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt;.</li> 
			<li>A header is written as == ... == at the beginning of a line.</li> 
			<li>
				List of items is written as:<br/> 
				* first<br/> 
				* second<br/> 
				* third<br/> 
				where the *'s must begin the lines.
			</li> 
			<li>A horizontal rule is denoted by ---- which must begin the line.</li> 
			<li>A character reference is denoted as e.g. &amp;oslash;.</li> 
			<li>A linebreak is written as &lt;br/&gt;.</li> 
			<li>Texts and whitespace are written literally.</li> 
		</ul>
		<p>Example of an article written in the wiki syntax:</p>
		<div class="code">
			<code>
				== The dWebTek Project ==<br/> 
				The [http://www.cs.au.dk/dWebTek/project.html project] involves:<br/> 
				* a Wiki [[server]]<br/> 
				* a Wiki [[metaserver]]<br/> 
				* a Wiki [[client]]<br/> 
				Pages are written in a subset of ''Wikipedia'' syntax
				and are translated into WikiXML using a Java
				class &lt;tt&gt;Txt2WikiXML&lt;/tt&gt;.<br/> 
				----<br/> 
				Note that the parser does '''not''' generate any syntax errors.<br/> 
				&lt;br/&gt;<br/> 
				Once the system is operational, you can write lots of Wiki pages.
			</code>
		</div>
		<h3>Creating, Editing &amp; Reading Articles</h3>
		<p>Use "_" to denote a space when trying to reach or create an article. E.g. an article on "computer science" is denoted "computer_science".</p>
		<p>Article names can only contain letters (a-zA-Z) and the underscore character (_).</p>
